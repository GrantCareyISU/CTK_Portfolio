          <p>A Monochrome Life is an upcoming video game being created by Grant Carey as a personal project. It will serve as both
            a puzzle game and social awareness expirement. The game has been completely grayscaled to place colorblind players on
            the same difficulty as those who are able to see color. The game will go throughout the various tasks of an average
            life, but without the advantage of solving with colors. Due to still being in development, there is no link.</p>
